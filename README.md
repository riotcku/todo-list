Simple To-do list
=================

An webapp made using Aurelia.js that functions as a simple to-do list.

----------

***Setup***

Apologies in advance for the setup process, javascript web apps are very annoying to set up.

Pre-requisites: npm v4+
Navigate to this directory on terminal and type

```
npm install

```

This will install gulp. You may need to use sudo to give write permission.

----------

***Running the application***

Navigate to this director on terminal.
Then, type ```gulp``` which will compile all the scss.

After, type ```http-server -o -c-1```.

This should default to localhost:8080. Go to localhost:8080 on your browser, and you should see the application.
