Simple To-do list
=================

A webapp based on Aurelia.js that functions as a simple to-do list.

----------

***Setup***

Apologies in advance for the setup process, javascript web apps, as you know, require a lot of stuff...

Pre-requisites: Node.js, npm v4+
Navigate to this directory on terminal and type

```
npm install
```

This will install gulp. You may need to use sudo to give write permission. Then, navigate to the ```/server``` directory on the terminal and again type
```
npm install
```
This will install a bunch of server utilities for node.

----------

***Running the application***

Navigate to this directory on terminal. Then, type ```gulp``` which will compile all the scss to css.

After, navigate to the ```/server``` directory then type ```node server.js```.

Node then should spin the server up at localhost:8080. Go to localhost:8080 on your browser, and you should see the application.
